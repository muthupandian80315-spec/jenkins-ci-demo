- GitHub
- Linux
- Shell Scripting

## What I Did
- Launched an Ubuntu EC2 instance on AWS
- Installed and configured Jenkins
- Integrated Jenkins with a GitHub repository
- Created a CI job to automatically execute a shell script
- Implemented a Jenkins pipeline using Jenkinsfile

## Project Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub
3. Jenkins executes the build script (`test.sh`)
4. Build status is displayed in Jenkins dashboard

## Outcome
